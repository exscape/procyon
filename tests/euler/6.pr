# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and
# the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and
# the square of the sum.
#
# NOTE: the problem statement appears to be backwards, as the expected answer is really
# the negative of what they actually ask for.
# The example is also backwards; the difference between sum(squares) and square(sum) is -2640,
# not 2640.
